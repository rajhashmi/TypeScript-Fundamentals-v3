//  TypeScript is an open source, typed syntactic supset of javaScript

// Imagine a Safer JavaScript: Introducing TypeScript

// JavaScript is a powerful and widely-used programming language for creating interactive and dynamic websites. It's like the paintbrush of the web, allowing developers to create beautiful and functional web applications. However, JavaScript doesn't catch all mistakes before you run your code, which can lead to unexpected errors when your program is running.

// Enter TypeScript, your coding safety net. TypeScript is like adding a layer of intelligence to JavaScript. It's designed to help you write better code by catching mistakes early and providing clearer insights into your program.
